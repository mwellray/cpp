/*The Fruit structure contains three members.

The first member holds the name of the fruit.

The second member holds the weight (which may have a fractional part) of the fruit in lbs,

and the third member holds the number of calories(an integer value) in the per lb of the fruit.

Write a program that declares such a structure and creates a Fruit variable called TodaysFruit. 

The program further ask the users to give the name, weight and the calories for 5 -
-(let us call them as FruitA, FruitB, FruitC, FruitD, and FruitE) fruits -
-and stores that information in the TodaysFruit variable. 

Once these are stored, the contents of the structure variable TodaysFruit should be displayed. 
For asking the users to give input and later on for displaying the details of the TodaysFruit use some sort of loop. */
